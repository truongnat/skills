# Third-Party Skills

The skills below are vendored from skills.sh sources. They were selected from
established maintainers, checked for a redistribution-friendly license, and
imported only when Gen Agent Trust Hub and Socket reported Safe / 0 alerts.
Skills with Snyk High Risk (for example `secrets-management`) were excluded.

### Upstream metadata exception (Expo)

`expo-native-ui` and `expo-data-fetching` keep their upstream
`agents/openai.yaml` files. That metadata is **optional host tooling only**.
They remain third-party skills: no first-party `Contract (mandatory)`, not listed
in `docs/first-party-skills.json`, and not validated as report/office skills.
Do not treat the presence of `openai.yaml` as a first-party signal.

Office document skills (`xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`, `pdf`) are first-party Python
skills in this repository (MIT). Anthropic document skills were intentionally
not vendored: their license does not permit retaining or redistributing copies
outside Anthropic services.

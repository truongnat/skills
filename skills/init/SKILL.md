# Project Init

## Shared preamble (do this first)

Read and follow `.agents/SKILL_PREAMBLE.md` now (Language + Memory) before
Purpose, Contract, or steps. Do not skip it; do not reuse a cached `language`
from earlier in the session. Source copy in this repo: `docs/SKILL_PREAMBLE.md`.

## Purpose

Build a reliable project reference before other lifecycle skills run. Collect
facts from the repository, record sources and confidence, and configure
project-specific behavior without inventing conventions.

## Contract (mandatory)

| Field | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Inputs | Repository root, existing `.agents/settings.yaml` and `.agents/PRJ_REFERENCE.md` when present, source/config/docs/tests, git metadata, user-confirmed project rules. |
| Outputs | `.agents/PRJ_REFERENCE.md` and a merged `.agents/settings.yaml`. |
| Safety | Read-only discovery. Never read or record secret values. Never execute **project** code, install dependencies, or mutate source files. Running the bundled read-only `scripts/scan_workspaces.sh` (filesystem sweep only) is allowed. Preserve existing user settings unless explicitly replaced. Mark uncertain facts; do not invent business or workflow rules. |

### Required artifacts

#### `.agents/PRJ_REFERENCE.md`

- Required: yes.
- **executive_summary**: The most useful 20% of project context.
- **project_identity**: Purpose, users, domain, lifecycle status.
- **workspaces**: For a monorepo, one row per app/package/service with its
  path, type, and its **own** stack, entry point, and commands. Never collapse
  a multi-stack monorepo into a single root stack.
- **tech_stack**: Languages, frameworks, runtime, package/build tools. In a
  monorepo, record the stack **per workspace** (see `workspaces`), not only the
  root manifest.
- **architecture**: Components, boundaries, entry points, data flows.
- **business_rules**: Rule, source, affected area, confidence.
- **key_constraints**: Technical, business, compliance, compatibility.
- **commands**: Setup, build, test, lint, run, migration commands.
- **conventions**: Code, branch, commit, PR, reporting, decision-gate, and visual conventions.
- **security_notes**: Security boundaries and handling rules, without secrets.
- **references**: Authoritative file/path/URL references.
- **unknowns**: Missing or conflicting information requiring confirmation.
- **freshness**: Generated/updated time, source commit, mode.

#### `.agents/settings.yaml`

- Required: yes; merge in place.
- Preserve `language` and any user-authored values.
- Populate only repository-evidenced or user-confirmed project rules.
- Do not copy descriptive project facts here; link to
  `.agents/PRJ_REFERENCE.md`.

## Modes

| Mode | Use | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `init` | Reference is missing | Create from the template. |
| `refresh` | Existing reference may be stale | Update changed facts and preserve confirmed content. |
| `force` | User explicitly requests regeneration | Re-scan all sources and rebuild the reference; merge settings without silently resetting user choices. |

## Workflow (step by step)

1. Read `.agents/settings.yaml` and existing project reference, if any.
2. Select mode: `init`, `refresh`, or explicit `force`.
3. Inventory repository facts using read-only inspection:
   - git root, remotes (redact credentials), branches, default/base branch;
   - manifests, lockfiles, build/test/lint configs, CI, containers, migrations;
   - source layout, entry points, public interfaces, tests, documentation;
   - business rules and constraints evidenced by docs, tests, schemas, or code.
4. **Deep workspace scan (mandatory — do not scan only the root, and do not
   enumerate from the workspace config).** The scan has two responsibilities,
   split so that no stack is ever missed:

   **a. Coverage (deterministic) — run the bundled candidate surfacer.** It
   sweeps the **filesystem** (not the workspace config) and prints every
   plausible project-root directory, pruned of build/generated/platform noise:

   ```bash
   bash .agents/skills/init/scripts/scan_workspaces.sh
   ```

   Each row is `DIR<TAB>MARKER_HINTS`. The hints (e.g. `pubspec.yaml`,
   `package.json`, or `-` for none) are only clues; the script deliberately does
   **not** classify the stack.

   **b. Classification (yours) — you decide each stack.** For **every** row,
   open the directory and identify its stack from its actual manifest/tooling
   using your own knowledge — **any** ecosystem counts (Node/TS, Flutter/Dart,
   Go, Rust, Python, JVM, Kotlin, Swift, .NET, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, Deno, Zig, …).
   Do not limit yourself to a fixed list; a directory whose hint is `-` still
   gets inspected and classified.
   - **Record every candidate** in the `workspaces` table and give each its own
     `tech_stack`, entry point, and per-app commands. A directory of a different
     ecosystem is a distinct stack that MUST appear.
   - **Why the config is not enough:** a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `turbo.json` /
     root `package.json "workspaces"` lists only JS/TS members. A Flutter/Dart,
     Go, Rust, or Python app under `apps/` is typically **not** listed there, so
     enumerating from the config silently drops whole stacks. Filesystem
     coverage is the source of truth; the config is only supporting evidence.
   - The surfacer's hint list is best-effort, not exhaustive. If you know of a
     project directory it did not surface (unusual layout or ecosystem), add it
     — never treat the script's rows as the complete universe of stacks.
   - If the script cannot run (e.g. no Bash), fall back to a manual recursive
     directory sweep that prunes `node_modules`, build/generated, and native
     platform dirs, and classify every project root yourself — never bound the
     sweep by the workspace config.
6. Classify every important statement:
   - `confirmed`: direct source or user confirmation;
   - `inferred`: evidence exists but is indirect;
   - `unknown`: unresolved or conflicting.
7. Seed from `templates/PRJ_REFERENCE.template.md`, fill all applicable
   sections, and keep source references close to each fact.
8. Merge confirmed project conventions into `.agents/settings.yaml`.
   Preserve `language`, security hard rules, and custom user values.
9. Validate:
   - no secret values or sensitive file contents;
   - executive summary appears first and is decision-oriented;
   - commands are sourced, not guessed;
   - every workspace member with its own manifest has its own stack recorded
     (no multi-stack monorepo collapsed to a single root stack);
   - unknowns and conflicts are visible.
10. Report created/updated files and the highest-priority unknowns.

## Discovery boundaries

Do not open `.env`, credential stores, private keys, production dumps, or
secret-manager payloads. File names may be listed when needed; values must
never be read or copied.

## Handoff

All subsequent skills must read `.agents/settings.yaml` and
`.agents/PRJ_REFERENCE.md` before making project-specific decisions. If the
reference is missing or materially stale, run this skill first.

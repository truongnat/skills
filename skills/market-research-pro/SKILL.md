  Professional market research: market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), competitor benchmarking, customer segmentation, pricing and positioning hypotheses, trend scanning, evidence quality scoring, and decision-ready synthesis.

  Use this skill when the user asks to validate market opportunity, compare competitors, estimate market size with assumptions, identify ICP segments, prioritize country/vertical expansion, or produce an executive-style market brief with citations and explicit confidence levels.

  Use **with** **`web-research-pro`** for official and current external sources, **`business-analysis-pro`** to convert findings into requirements/roadmaps, and **`data-analysis-pro`** when survey or tabular datasets need numeric analysis. This skill (`market-research-pro`) owns **research framing and synthesis quality**; other skills own deep implementation or analytics details.

  Triggers: "market research", "TAM", "SAM", "SOM", "competitor analysis", "ICP", "go-to-market", "positioning", "pricing", "market size", "industry trends", "benchmark", "category landscape", "entry strategy", "bottom-up sizing", "top-down", "wedge", "category creation", "SAM vs SOM", "evidence scorecard", "substitute competitor".

# Market research (professional)

Use official company sources, regulatory filings, and high-quality industry reports as preferred evidence; this skill encodes **assumption-driven sizing**, **source reliability ranking**, and **decision-ready** synthesis. Confirm **market definition**, **geography**, **time horizon**, and **decision context** (invest, build, expand, price).

## Related skills (this repo)

| Skill | When to combine with `market-research-pro` |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| **`web-research-pro`** | Collect and verify external sources, changelogs, and citation quality |
| **`business-analysis-pro`** | Convert findings into initiative scope, requirements, and priority |
| **`data-analysis-pro`** | Analyze survey/usage/exported datasets numerically |
| **`seo-pro`** | Search-demand and organic visibility angle for web-first products |

**Boundary:** **`market-research-pro`** = what market signals mean for decisions; **`web-research-pro`** = how to gather/verify sources.

## When to use

- Market sizing with transparent assumptions (TAM/SAM/SOM).
- Competitor landscape and differentiated positioning.
- ICP/segment prioritization and expansion hypotheses.
- Pricing and packaging hypothesis framing (not final finance model).
- Trend scan for strategic direction with citation discipline.
- Trigger keywords: `market research`, `TAM`, `competitor`, `ICP`, `positioning`, `pricing`, ...

## Workflow

1. Confirm decision to support (go/no-go, segment priority, pricing hypothesis), market boundaries, and timeframe.
2. Apply the principles and topic summaries below; open `references/` when you need depth; gather external evidence via **`web-research-pro`** and cite source quality.
3. Respond using **Suggested response format**; note uncertainty, assumption sensitivity, and data freshness risk.

### Operating principles

1. **Define market before sizing** - avoid mixing categories and geographies.
2. **Assumptions are first-class** - every number has a method and confidence.
3. **Evidence quality matters** - official and recent sources outweigh generic blogs.
4. **Compare like-for-like** - competitors by segment, price tier, and use case.
5. **Decision orientation** - outputs must support a concrete choice, not only description.
6. **Freshness and reproducibility** - keep source dates and calculation steps visible.

### Versions, geo, currency (summary)

- Fiscal vs calendar year; FX date; regional market definitions.

### Suggested response format (implement / review)

1. **Issue or goal** - Business decision and market scope.
2. **Recommendation** - Segment/positioning/sizing conclusion with rationale and confidence.
3. **Code** - Tables (assumptions, competitor matrix, scorecards), formulas, or checklist - still labeled **Code**.
4. **Residual risks** - Data gaps, assumption sensitivity, timing and execution risk.

## Quick examples

**Input (simple):** "Should we launch B2B payroll SaaS in Vietnam first, then Thailand?"  
**Expected output:** Define TAM/SAM assumptions per country, compare competitor intensity and ICP fit, propose entry sequence with confidence and key unknowns.

**Input (tricky):** "TAM is $50B from one paid report — use it in the board deck."  
**Expected output:** **Triangulate** with bottom-up; show **sensitivity**; label **vendor bias**; ranges not false precision; **`web-research-pro`** for corroboration.

**Input (cross-skill):** "Survey CSV + decide EU vs US first."  
**Expected output:** **`data-analysis-pro`** for weights, segments, significance caveats; **this skill** for market framing, competitor overlay, and **decision** narrative with confidence.

## Checklist before calling the skill done

- [ ] Market boundaries (category, geo, timeframe) are explicit.
- [ ] Sizing assumptions and confidence are visible.
- [ ] Source quality and recency are stated.
- [ ] Recommendation is tied to a specific business decision.
- [ ] Follow-up handoff to `business-analysis-pro` / `data-analysis-pro` when needed.
- [ ] **Substitutes** and **category** definition sanity-checked (not narrow “no competitors”).
- [ ] **Spurious precision** avoided — ranges and scenarios where data is thin.

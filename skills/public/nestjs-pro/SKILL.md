  Professional NestJS backend development: module design, API/DX quality, security patterns, and production edge cases.

  Use this skill when the user works on NestJS, Node.js APIs, modules, providers, guards, pipes, interceptors, filters, Swagger/OpenAPI, Prisma/TypeORM, microservices, WebSockets, GraphQL, Bull queues, testing (unit/e2e), or asks for Nest code review, DTO validation, exception mapping, lifecycle, or deployment concerns.

  PostgreSQL RLS with Nest: row-level security, tenant context per request, `SET LOCAL` / `set_config`, Prisma transaction + RLS, TypeORM QueryRunner + RLS, RLS with PgBouncer, middleware/interceptor setting tenant before DB, or when combining JWT guards with database policies.

# NestJS (professional)

Use official [NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com) for API truth; this skill encodes **professional defaults**, **API and developer experience**, and **edge-case awareness**. Confirm **Nest major version** and **ORM / transport** from the project when known.

## When to use

- Designing or refactoring modules, controllers, services, and cross-cutting concerns.
- Reviewing Nest code for DI clarity, validation, security (authz), and consistent HTTP responses.
- Debugging lifecycle, shutdown, transactions, queues, or multi-instance behavior.
- Aligning APIs with predictable errors, DTO contracts, versioning, and documentation (OpenAPI).
- Wiring **PostgreSQL RLS** from Nest: per-request tenant context, Prisma/TypeORM transaction boundaries, pooling (PgBouncer).

## Operating principles

1. **Module boundaries** — Feature modules own their domain; shared kernel stays minimal; avoid god modules.
2. **Explicit contracts** — DTOs + `class-validator` / `class-transformer` at the edge; services work with domain types, not raw `any`.
3. **Security by default** — Guards for authz; never trust client input; secrets via `ConfigService`, not env reads scattered in code.
4. **Fail predictably** — Map domain errors to HTTP with `HttpException` or custom filters; avoid leaking stack traces in production.
5. **Verify versions in-repo** — Check `package.json` and Nest migration guides before suggesting APIs that changed across majors.
6. **RLS is enforced in Postgres** — Nest guards are not enough if the policy requires `current_setting`; set context in the same transaction as queries; see [references/postgresql-rls-integration.md](references/postgresql-rls-integration.md) and SQL details in **`postgresql-pro`**.

## API design and DX (summary)

- Consistent **error shape** (status, code, message, optional `details`) for clients and observability.
- **Pagination / filtering** conventions documented once (query DTOs, max limits).
- **OpenAPI** annotations or plugin where the team uses Swagger — keep DTOs the single source of truth.
- **Idempotency** for mutating endpoints where payments or webhooks matter (document keys and storage).
- **Versioning** strategy explicit (URI, header, or media type) before breaking changes accumulate.

## Tips and tricks (summary)

- Prefer **`@Injectable()`** with explicit constructor injection; use **`@Inject(TOKEN)`** for custom providers and dynamic modules.
- **`ValidationPipe`** with `whitelist`, `forbidNonWhitelisted`, `transform` globally — strip unknown fields early.
- **Scoped providers** (`REQUEST`, `TRANSIENT`) only when needed — understand memory and performance tradeoffs.
- **Interceptors** for logging, timeouts, and response mapping; **Filters** for exception normalization.
- **Testing**: isolate services with mocked providers; e2e with `TestingModule` + real HTTP stack when integration matters.

Details: [references/tips-and-tricks.md](references/tips-and-tricks.md)

## Edge cases (summary)

- **Circular dependencies** — `forwardRef()` between modules; prefer restructuring boundaries first.
- **Shutdown** — `enableShutdownHooks()` and close DB/queue connections; drain Bull workers gracefully.
- **Transactions** — unit of work boundaries; avoid long-held transactions across `await` to unrelated I/O.
- **Multi-instance** — Bull locks, idempotent jobs; WebSocket adapters with Redis for scale-out.
- **Global state** — avoid mutable singletons holding request data; use `ClsService` / ALS patterns if needed.

## PostgreSQL RLS with NestJS (summary)

- **Policies** are defined in PostgreSQL — use skill **`postgresql-pro`** for `CREATE POLICY`, `USING` / `WITH CHECK`, and performance.
- In Nest, **set tenant (or actor) context** after auth, **before** queries: `SET LOCAL` or `set_config` inside the **same transaction** as ORM work when using transaction pooling.
- **Prisma**: often `SET` + queries inside `.$transaction()`; verify interaction with connection pool.
- **TypeORM**: prefer `QueryRunner` + transaction so session state does not leak across requests.
- **PgBouncer** transaction mode: **session** variables are unreliable across transactions — align with [postgresql-rls-integration.md](references/postgresql-rls-integration.md).

## Suggested response format (implement / review)

1. **Issue or goal** — What is wrong or what we are building.
2. **Recommendation** — Nest patterns, module placement, security or DX impact.
3. **Code** — Minimal module/controller/service/DTO snippets or diff-style blocks.
4. **Residual risks** — Migration steps, load testing, or ops follow-up.

## Pre-merge checklist

- [ ] DTOs validated at boundary; sensitive fields never exposed in responses (`@Exclude` / serializers).
- [ ] Authn/authz applied consistently (global guard or per-route metadata).
- [ ] Errors mapped to HTTP semantics; no raw DB errors to clients in production.
- [ ] Logging structured (request id) where applicable; PII redaction policy respected.
- [ ] Database migrations or schema changes reviewed; transactions for multi-step writes.
- [ ] **RLS**: if using Postgres RLS, tenant context is set correctly for pool + ORM; policies tested as app DB role (see `postgresql-pro`).
- [ ] Tests cover happy path + at least one failure mode for critical flows.

  Professional application and platform security: threat modeling, secure design, authn/authz, secrets, crypto hygiene, API and client hardening, and operational security signals — cross-stack (web, mobile, API, backend, cloud).

  Use this skill when the user asks about security review, OWASP-style risks, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, injection, IDOR/BOLA, JWT/session hardening, TLS, headers (CSP, HSTS), secrets management, rate limiting, audit logging, dependency/supply-chain risk, mobile secure storage, or hardening CI/CD pipelines.

  Use this skill for **network-aware security**: OSI / TCP–IP mapping, DNS/TLS/segmentation concepts, and how attacks relate to layers. Use it for **attack-method literacy** (MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP testing mindset, kill-chain phases) from a **defender** perspective. Use it for **authorized** offensive simulation: internal pen-test style workflows, staging/lab self-assessment, purple-team exercises, and structured bug reporting — **never** for unauthorized testing.

  Use **with** stack skills for implementation wiring: **`nestjs-pro`** (Guards, ValidationPipe, HTTP errors), **`nextjs-pro`** (middleware, Server Actions, env boundaries), **`postgresql-pro`** (RLS, least-privilege roles), **`react-pro`** / **`flutter-pro`** / **`react-native-pro`** (XSS-safe UI, WebView, deep links), **`testing-pro`** (security-focused tests, SAST/DAST hooks in CI). This skill (`security-pro`) owns **cross-platform security principles and threat framing**; framework skills own **framework-specific APIs**.

# Security (professional)

Use [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) materials (Top 10, ASVS, cheat sheets) and your org’s security policy for authoritative guidance; this skill encodes **defense-in-depth habits**, **threat-aware design**, **network-layer context** (OSI/TCP–IP as a mental model), and **platform-agnostic** controls. Confirm **deployment model** (internet-facing, internal, mobile, multi-tenant), **regulatory** constraints, and **stack** when combining with repo `*-pro` skills. Any **simulated attack** or **pentest-style** activity must stay **in scope and authorized** (see `references/offensive-simulation-and-self-assessment.md`).

## Related skills (this repo)

| Skill | When to combine with `security-pro` |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| **`nestjs-pro`** | Guards, pipes, DTO validation, exception filters, OpenAPI |
| **`nextjs-pro`** | Middleware, RSC vs client secrets, `NEXT_PUBLIC_` boundaries |
| **`postgresql-pro`** | RLS, roles, `BYPASSRLS`, migration safety |
| **`react-pro`** | XSS-safe patterns, CSP implications for client bundles |
| **`flutter-pro`** / **`react-native-pro`** | Secure storage, platform channels, deep links |
| **`testing-pro`** | Security test strategy, abuse-case tests in CI |

Do **not** duplicate framework-specific wiring; state **what** to enforce here and **where** to implement in the sibling skill.

## When to use

- **Threat modeling** or security review of a feature, API, or architecture.
- Hardening **authn/authz**, **sessions**, or **tokens** across web/mobile/API.
- **Secrets**, **TLS**, **headers**, **CORS**, **rate limiting**, **logging** (redaction).
- **Dependency** / supply-chain and **CI** security gates.
- **OSI / TCP–IP**, segmentation, DNS/TLS, and how **network** properties affect app threats (e.g. SSRF, MITM assumptions).
- **Attack-method** literacy: mapping controls to **MITRE ATT&CK** / OWASP-style classes; prioritizing detections and tests.
- **Authorized** self-assessment: staging/lab testing, purple-team collaboration, structured **findings** reports.
- Trigger keywords: `OWASP`, `XSS`, `JWT`, `RLS`, `secrets`, `CSP`, `threat model`, `IDOR`, `OSI`, `MITRE`, `pentest`, …

## Workflow

1. Confirm trust boundaries, sensitivity of data, deployment surface, and which **stack skills** apply.
2. Apply the principles and topic summaries below; open `references/` when you need depth; defer implementation details to **`nestjs-pro`** / **`nextjs-pro`** / **`postgresql-pro`** / … when applicable.
3. Respond using **Suggested response format**; note residual risks, verification (tests, pen-test), and compliance follow-ups when relevant.

### Operating principles

1. **Assume breach** — Layer controls; monitor and limit blast radius.
2. **Server-side truth** — Authorization and business rules enforced where attackers can’t bypass (API/server).
3. **Least privilege** — Users, services, DB roles, cloud IAM — minimum necessary.
4. **No secrets in code or logs** — Vault/CI secrets; structured redaction.
5. **Validate and encode** — Every boundary; context-appropriate encoding for output.
6. **Secure defaults** — Deny by default; explicit allow for dangerous operations.
7. **Authorized testing only** — No offensive simulation against systems or data outside **written scope** (even “your” prod may require approval).

### Fundamentals and threat modeling (summary)

- STRIDE-style thinking: **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation disclosure, **D**enial of service, **E**levation of privilege — map to your system.
- Data classification drives controls (PII, payment, health).
- Document **trust boundaries** (browser, CDN, API gateway, DB).

Details: [references/fundamentals-and-threat-model.md](references/fundamentals-and-threat-model.md)

### OSI and networking (summary)

- Seven-layer **OSI** model as a map for **where** controls and failures appear; **TCP/IP** mapping for real stacks.
- **DNS**, **TLS**, **segmentation** (L2–L7) tied to common issues: SSRF, smuggling class bugs, lateral movement in flat networks.

Details: [references/osi-and-networking.md](references/osi-and-networking.md)

### Attack techniques and methods (summary)

- **Kill-chain** phases and **MITRE ATT&CK** / **OWASP** as catalogs — to design **detections**, **tests**, and **reviews**, not unauthorized exploitation.
- Web/API classes (injection, access control, SSRF, XSS) linked to **defensive** anchors.

Details: [references/attack-techniques-and-methods.md](references/attack-techniques-and-methods.md)

### Offensive simulation and self-assessment (summary)

- **Pen-test**, **red/purple** team, **bug bounty** — roles and when each fits.
- **Safe lab**: isolated env, synthetic data, CI-friendly **SAST/DAST/SCA**; **reporting** template for internal findings.

Details: [references/offensive-simulation-and-self-assessment.md](references/offensive-simulation-and-self-assessment.md)

### Tips and tricks (summary)

- Short-lived credentials; **rotate** on incident; **MFA** for privileged access.
- **Parameterized queries** / ORM correctly; never concatenate user input into SQL/shell.
- **Rate limit** auth and expensive endpoints; **size limits** on bodies and uploads.
- **Dependency** scanning and patch process; pin CI **third-party actions** to commit SHA when possible.

Details: [references/tips-and-tricks.md](references/tips-and-tricks.md)

### Edge cases (summary)

- **JWT** misuse (long-lived, sensitive claims in client, algorithm `none`).
- **BOLA** / IDOR on every resource id exposed in APIs.
- **Multi-tenant** isolation failures (cache, logs, admin tools).
- **CI** secrets exposed to untrusted PR workflows.

Details: [references/edge-cases.md](references/edge-cases.md)

### Anti-patterns (summary)

- **Client-only authz**, **tokens in localStorage for sensitive ops**, **PII in logs/URLs** — [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md).

### Integration map (summary)

- Same table as **Related skills**, expanded with ownership: [references/integration-map.md](references/integration-map.md).

### Suggested response format (implement / review)

1. **Issue or goal** — Asset, threat, or compliance driver; which **Related skill** implements the fix.
2. **Recommendation** — Controls (prevent/detect/respond), priority, and stack touchpoints.
3. **Code** — Config snippet, pseudo-policy, checklist, or secure pattern — not a full framework tutorial duplicated from other skills.
4. **Residual risks** — Gaps for pen-test, monitoring, or process (patch cadence, IR).

## Quick example

### 1 — Simple (common)

**Input:** Public REST API returns 200 with another user’s order when `orderId` is guessed — possible IDOR.  
**Expected output:** Recommend server-side **authorization** check on every read; deny by default; cite **BOLA**; point to **`nestjs-pro`** for Guard placement; add integration test per **`testing-pro`**.

### 2 — Tricky (edge case)

**Input:** Admin UI hides a button, but the API still performs the action when called directly.  
**Expected output:** Classify as **broken access control**; enforce authz on server; UI hiding is not a control; add negative tests.

### 3 — Cross-skill

**Input:** Team wants a “hack ourselves” Friday on **staging** with a findings report.  
**Expected output:** Scope + **ROE** checklist from [references/offensive-simulation-and-self-assessment.md](references/offensive-simulation-and-self-assessment.md); tool categories (SAST/DAST/SCA); severity matrix; **no** prod testing without approval; link **`testing-pro`** for regression tests.

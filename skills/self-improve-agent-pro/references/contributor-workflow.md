# Contributor Workflow — Harvesting Knowledge

This guide explains how to turn a successful problem-solving session in an external repo into a permanent improvement for the `skills` repository.

## The Trigger
You should initiate a **Contributor PR** when:
1. You fix a bug that wasn't covered by existing `SKILL.md` or `references/`.
2. You discover a new edge case or a tricky interaction between two technologies.
3. You optimize a prompt or a workflow that significantly reduces token usage (Idea 2).
4. You find a "gotcha" that cost more than 2 turns to debug.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify the Target
Determine which skill or reference file should host this new knowledge.
- Is it a general principle? -> `SKILL.md`
- Is it a specific edge case? -> `references/edge-cases.md`
- Is it a new pattern? -> `references/tips-and-tricks.md`

### 2. Prepare the Content
Format the discovery using the repository's standard:
- **Case**: What was the problem?
- **Solution**: How was it fixed?
- **Prevention**: How can we avoid it next time?

### 3. Execute the PR (The Loop)
Use `git-operations-pro` to:
1. `git checkout -b contrib/update-{{skill-name}}-{{date}}`
2. Apply the change to the skill file.
3. Commit with a message: `feat(skill): add edge case for {{context}} discovered in {{project}}`
4. Provide the user with the branch name to push and PR.

## Token-Driven Optimization
If a workflow summary shows excessive token usage (>50k tokens or >10 interactions):
1. Analyze the conversation history for redundancy.
2. Propose a more "surgical" prompt or a better specialized skill.
3. Create a Contributor PR to update the `prompts/` or `skills/` with the optimized version.

## Anti-patterns
- **Polluting**: Adding very specific project logic that isn't reusable.
- **Bloating**: Adding large blocks of code without explanation.
- **Duplicate**: Adding a rule that already exists in a different skill.

  Professional strategic consulting: problem framing, strategic options, scenario planning, portfolio and capability fit, prioritization, and decision-ready recommendations for leadership.

  Use this skill when the user needs board/executive-level strategy support: growth choices, market-entry sequencing, build/partner/buy decisions, operating model trade-offs, strategic risks, or a concise strategy memo with assumptions and confidence levels.

  Use **with** **`market-research-pro`** for market and competitor evidence, **`business-analysis-pro`** for requirements and execution planning, and **`web-research-pro`** for external source validation. This skill (`strategic-consulting-pro`) owns **strategy framing and option evaluation**; other skills own deep domain analysis and implementation detail.

  Triggers: "strategy", "strategic consulting", "go-to-market strategy", "market entry", "prioritization", "portfolio strategy", "build vs buy", "partner strategy", "operating model", "scenario planning", "decision memo", "north star", "strategic options", "kill criteria", "RACI strategy", "initiative sequencing", "moat", "where to play", "how to win", "strategic risk".

# Strategic consulting (professional)

Use reputable strategic frameworks and current business evidence as references; this skill encodes **decision-driven strategy synthesis**, **trade-off clarity**, and **assumption transparency**. Confirm **decision owner**, **time horizon**, **constraints** (capital, people, regulation), and **success metrics**.

## Related skills (this repo)

| Skill | When to combine with `strategic-consulting-pro` |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **`market-research-pro`** | Market sizing, competitor structure, segment attractiveness |
| **`business-analysis-pro`** | Turn strategic choices into initiative scope and requirements |
| **`web-research-pro`** | Verify external claims, recency, and source quality |
| **`data-analysis-pro`** | Quantitative support (scenario models, KPI baselines) |

**Boundary:** **`strategic-consulting-pro`** = strategic choices and trade-offs; **`business-analysis-pro`** = delivery requirements and execution artifacts.

## When to use

- Clarifying strategic problem statements before jumping to solutions.
- Evaluating options with explicit criteria and trade-offs.
- Prioritizing initiatives under limited resources.
- Building leadership-facing strategy memos and recommendations.
- Scenario planning under uncertainty and risk.
- Trigger keywords: `strategy`, `portfolio`, `scenario`, `prioritization`, `build vs buy`, ...

## Workflow

1. Confirm decision context (owner, horizon, constraints, target outcomes) and define the strategic question.
2. Apply the principles and topic summaries below; open `references/` when you need depth; gather market evidence via **`market-research-pro`** / **`web-research-pro`** where needed.
3. Respond using **Suggested response format**; note assumption sensitivity, execution risks, and data freshness limits.

### Operating principles

1. **Decision first** - start from the choice to be made, not framework theater.
2. **Options with criteria** - compare alternatives on shared criteria, not narrative bias.
3. **Transparent assumptions** - each recommendation must show key assumptions and confidence.
4. **Feasibility with ambition** - include capability, timing, and execution realities.
5. **Risk-aware** - identify downside, mitigation, and early warning indicators.
6. **Actionable synthesis** - strategy output must translate into concrete next actions.

- Political constraints, conflicting stakeholders, and low-data environments.

Details: [references/edge-cases.md](references/edge-cases.md)

### Decision flow and anti-patterns (summary)

- Decision type, uncertainty handling, stakeholder conflict; analysis paralysis.

Details: [references/decision-tree.md](references/decision-tree.md) · [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md)

### Cross-skill handoffs (summary)

### Versions and memo hygiene (summary)

- Planning period, framework shorthand, revision when assumptions change.

Details: [references/versions.md](references/versions.md)

### Suggested response format (implement / review)

1. **Issue or goal** - Strategic decision and constraints.
2. **Recommendation** - Preferred option, trade-offs, and confidence.
3. **Code** - Decision matrix, scenario table, or prioritization rubric - still labeled **Code**.
4. **Residual risks** - Assumption fragility, execution risk, and monitoring needs.

## Quick examples

**Input (simple):** "Should we prioritize enterprise upsell or SME expansion next two quarters?"  
**Expected output:** Present option criteria, scenario outcomes, capability constraints, and a sequenced recommendation with confidence and risks.

**Input (tricky):** "CEO wants one slide — but we need 20 pages of analysis."  
**Expected output:** **One-slide** thesis + **appendix** map; **time-box**; **decision** and **rejected** options explicit; avoid jargon-only deck.

**Input (cross-skill):** "Pick build vs buy for auth — then roadmap it."  
**Expected output:** **This skill** for criteria, options, risk; **`auth-pro`** for technical trade-offs; **`planning-pro`** for waves/dependencies; **`market-research-pro`** if vendor landscape unclear.

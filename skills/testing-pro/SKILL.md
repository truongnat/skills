  Professional software testing and test automation: test design, unit/integration/e2e layers, CI pipelines, flakiness, and quality signals.

  Use this skill when the user writes or reviews tests, sets up automation (CI/CD), uses Jest/Vitest/Mocha, React Testing Library, Playwright, Cypress, pytest, JUnit, TestNG, xUnit, Detox, XCTest, Espresso, k6/Gatling, Pact/contract tests, Testcontainers, or asks about coverage, mocks, stubs, TDD, BDD, test data, parallel runs, selectors, snapshots, visual regression, API testing, load/performance tests, or debugging flaky tests.

  Use **with** the relevant framework skill when tests are product-specific: **`react-pro`** / **`nextjs-pro`** (RTL, SSR/hydration test setup), **`nestjs-pro`** (TestingModule, e2e HTTP), **`flutter-pro`** (widget_test, integration_test), **`react-native-pro`** (Detox/Jest RN), **`postgresql-pro`** (DB fixtures, migration tests). This skill (`testing-pro`) owns **strategy, layers, CI, and flakiness**; framework skills own **APIs and project conventions** for that stack.

# Testing (professional)

Use official docs for each runner (e.g. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) for API truth; this skill encodes **professional test strategy**, **automation hygiene**, and **CI-friendly** patterns shared across stacks. Confirm **language/runner**, **CI environment**, and **which bundled framework skill** applies when the codebase uses this repo’s `*-pro` skills.

## Related skills (this repo)

| Skill | When to combine with `testing-pro` |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| **`react-pro`** | RTL/Vitest/Jest setup, component tests, hooks |
| **`nextjs-pro`** | App Router, RSC/`"use client"` test boundaries, server vs client |
| **`nestjs-pro`** | `TestingModule`, Supertest e2e, provider mocks |
| **`flutter-pro`** | `widget_test`, `integration_test`, goldens |
| **`react-native-pro`** | Detox/Maestro, RN Jest config |
| **`postgresql-pro`** | Integration tests against real SQL, RLS, migrations |

Do **not** duplicate framework-specific testing advice that belongs in those skills; **link** them and add cross-cutting test design here.

## When to use

- Designing or refactoring a test suite (layers, naming, folder layout).
- **Automation**: CI workflows, parallel jobs, reports, artifacts, retries policy.
- Choosing tools (runner vs e2e vs browser vs API vs load).
- **Debugging** flaky tests, timeouts, async races, or environment drift.
- Reviewing **coverage** and what it does *not* prove.
- Trigger keywords: `test`, `e2e`, `Playwright`, `CI`, `pytest`, `flaky`, `coverage`, `mock`, …

## Workflow

1. Confirm stack and CI; identify the **framework skill** from the Related skills table if this repo’s skills apply.
2. Apply the principles and topic summaries below; open `references/` when you need depth; defer framework API details to **`react-pro`** / **`nextjs-pro`** / **`nestjs-pro`** / … when applicable.
3. Respond using **Suggested response format**; note CI cost, maintenance, and which skill owns follow-up detail.

### Operating principles

1. **Test behavior, not implementation** — Prefer public API / user-visible outcomes; avoid brittle internals unless unit-testing pure logic.
2. **Right layer** — Fast unit tests for logic; integration for DB/API/contracts; e2e for critical journeys — see [references/test-pyramid-and-strategy.md](references/test-pyramid-and-strategy.md).
3. **Determinism** — Control time (`fake timers`), network (mocks/MSW), and data (fixtures); isolate side effects.
4. **CI is the source of truth** — If it only passes locally, fix env parity (timeouts, seeds, ports).
5. **Flakiness is debt** — Quarantine + fix root cause; avoid unlimited retries as policy.
6. **Automation scope** — Automate what runs repeatedly on every change; manual/exploratory for what is expensive to script.

### Test pyramid and strategy (summary)

- Prefer **many fast unit**, **fewer integration**, **minimal e2e** for critical paths.
- **Risk-based** coverage: critical paths and regressions first; not every line for vanity metrics.

Details: [references/test-pyramid-and-strategy.md](references/test-pyramid-and-strategy.md)

### Automation and CI (summary)

- **Pipeline stages**: lint/typecheck → unit → integration → e2e (nightly or main branch if slow).
- **Parallelism**: shard by file or project; balance workers vs DB contention.
- **Artifacts**: reports (JUnit, HTML), traces/screenshots on failure; retain logs.
- **Secrets**: never log tokens; use CI secret stores and ephemeral env.

Details: [references/automation-and-ci.md](references/automation-and-ci.md)

### Tips and tricks (summary)

- **Frontend JS/TS**: Vitest/Jest + RTL; e2e: Playwright/Cypress — align with app router and SSR (**`nextjs-pro`** for Next-specific setup).
- **Backend**: pytest/xUnit/JUnit; Testcontainers for real DB/queue when needed (**`nestjs-pro`** for Nest test module patterns).
- **Contracts**: Pact or OpenAPI-based tests between services.
- **Load**: k6/Gatling for SLAs; separate from functional e2e.

Details: [references/tips-and-tricks.md](references/tips-and-tricks.md)

### Edge cases (summary)

- **Async**: await assertions; avoid `setTimeout` without synchronization.
- **Time**: freeze clocks; avoid real sleeps in CI.
- **Selectors**: prefer stable `data-testid` / roles over brittle CSS for e2e.
- **Parallel tests**: isolate data (unique IDs, transactions, containers).

Details: [references/edge-cases.md](references/edge-cases.md)

### Anti-patterns (summary)

- **E2E-only coverage**, **implementation-detail assertions**, **real sleeps**, **retry-as-policy** — [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md).

### Integration with other skills (summary)

- **`react-pro`**, **`nextjs-pro`**, **`nestjs-pro`**, **`security-pro`** — [references/integration-map.md](references/integration-map.md).

### Suggested response format (implement / review)

1. **Issue or goal** — What to verify (risk, regression, contract) and which **framework skill** applies if any.
2. **Recommendation** — Test layers, tools, CI stages; **explicit handoff** to `react-pro` / `nextjs-pro` / … when the answer is framework-specific.
3. **Code** — Minimal test sketch, CI YAML snippet, or checklist — not full framework tutorials duplicated from other skills.
4. **Residual risks** — Flakiness, env cost, coverage gaps, maintenance.

## Quick example

### 1 — Simple (common)

**Input:** E2E suite is slow and flaky; team runs everything on every PR.  
**Expected output:** Suggest split (smoke e2e on PR, full on main), parallel shards, stable selectors, deterministic data, and where to move checks to integration tests; point to **`nextjs-pro`** if failures involve RSC boundaries.

### 2 — Tricky (edge case)

**Input:** Tests pass alone but fail when the full file runs — order-dependent.  
**Expected output:** Find shared mutable state, `beforeEach` reset, database transaction rollback strategy; forbid test interdependence.

### 3 — Cross-skill

**Input:** Need regression tests for IDOR fix in API.  
**Expected output:** **`testing-pro`** for two-user fixture and negative assertions; **`nestjs-pro`** for how to spin `TestingModule` + HTTP; **`security-pro`** for the abuse scenario framing.

## Checklist before calling the skill done

- [ ] Test level matches risk (not all e2e).
- [ ] **Automation**: CI job order, caching, and failure artifacts defined.
- [ ] Deterministic data/time/network; no hidden sleeps as “fix”.
- [ ] Flaky tests tracked; root cause or quarantine with issue link.
- [ ] Selectors and API surfaces stable for maintenance.
- [ ] **RTL query** priority respected (`role`/label before `testId`).
- [ ] Security-sensitive paths have **negative** tests where applicable.
- [ ] Coverage interpreted as signal, not a single number.
- [ ] **Framework-specific** guidance delegated to the right **`react-pro`** / **`nextjs-pro`** / **`nestjs-pro`** / **`flutter-pro`** / **`react-native-pro`** / **`postgresql-pro`** when applicable — no duplicate of those skills’ scope.

        def process_payment(amount, card):
            return card.charge(amount)
      language: python
      context: Payment processing in e-commerce API
      focus_areas: [security, error-handling]
    output: |
      ## Executive Summary
      - Code lacks critical security and error handling
      - 2 critical issues, 1 important issue
      - Quality score: 3/10
      
      ## Critical Issues 🔴
      
      **1. No input validation**
      - Why critical: Allows SQL injection, XSS, invalid amounts
      - Fix:
      ```python
      def process_payment(amount: Decimal, card: Card) -> PaymentResult:
          if amount <= 0:
              raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
          if amount > MAX_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT:
              raise ValueError("Amount exceeds limit")
          # ... validate card
      ```
      
      **2. No error handling**
      - Why critical: Crashes on network errors, card declines
      - Fix: Wrap in try-except, return Result object
      
      ## Important Issues 🟡
      
      **1. No logging/audit trail**
      - Impact: Can't track transactions, debug issues
      - Add: logger.info(f"Processing payment: {amount} for {card.last4}")
      
      ## Refactored Code
      ```python
      from decimal import Decimal
      from typing import Result
      import logging
      
      logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
      
      def process_payment(
          amount: Decimal,
          card: Card,
          idempotency_key: str
      ) -> Result[PaymentResult, PaymentError]:
          """Process payment with validation and error handling."""
          
          # Validate inputs
          if amount <= 0:
              return Err(PaymentError.INVALID_AMOUNT)
          if not card.is_valid():
              return Err(PaymentError.INVALID_CARD)
          
          # Check idempotency
          if existing := check_idempotency(idempotency_key):
              return Ok(existing)
          
          # Log attempt

              f"Processing payment",
              extra={
                  "amount": str(amount),
                  "card_last4": card.last4,
                  "idempotency_key": idempotency_key
              }
          )
          
          # Process with error handling
          try:
              result = card.charge(amount)
              save_transaction(result, idempotency_key)
              return Ok(result)
          except NetworkError as e:

        age: 42

      The water tasted wrong.
      
      Dr. Sarah Chen held the sample vial to the viewport, watching
      ruddy Martian light filter through the supposedly pure liquid.
      Tiny crystalline structures floated inside—structures that
      shouldn't exist in treated water.
      
      "Computer, analyze sample 47-B."
      
      The lab's AI hummed. "Analysis complete. Detecting iron oxide
      particulate at 0.03%, and..." A pause. AIs didn't pause. "And
      prion-like protein structures. Unknown configuration."
      
      Sarah's hands steadied the vial, but her pulse hammered. Prions.
      On Mars. In the water supply for 10,000 colonists.
      
      She'd have to tell Administrator Wong. He'd tell her to run it
      again. To not cause a panic. To trust the system.
      
      Sarah was done trusting systems.
      
      Her fingers moved across the holographic keyboard, bypassing
      official channels. The message went directly to the colony's
      emergency broadcast: WATER SUPPLY COMPROMISED. CEASE CONSUMPTION.
      
      Klaxons wailed through the habitat. Wong would have her credentials
      revoked within the hour. But 10,000 people would still be alive
      to complain about it.
      
      Through the viewport, dust devils danced across the rust-red plain.
      Mars kept its secrets well. But Sarah Chen was stubbornly independent
      enough to drag them into the light, consequences be damned.

      # API Reference: User Management
      
      ## Overview
      
      The User Management API allows you to create, read, update, and
      delete user accounts programmatically. All endpoints require
      authentication and return JSON responses.
      
      **Base URL**: `https://api.example.com/v1`
      
      **Key Concepts**:
      - **User ID**: Unique identifier (UUID format)
      - **Role**: user, admin, or super_admin
      - **Status**: active, suspended, or deleted
      
      ## Authentication
      
      All requests require an API key in the Authorization header:
      
      ```bash
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
           https://api.example.com/v1/users
      ```
      
      ## Endpoints
      
      ### List Users
      
      ```
      GET /users
      ```
      
      **Parameters**:
      - `page` (integer, optional): Page number (default: 1)
      - `limit` (integer, optional): Results per page (default: 20, max: 100)
      - `role` (string, optional): Filter by role
      - `status` (string, optional): Filter by status
      
      **Request Example**:
      ```bash
      curl https://api.example.com/v1/users?page=1&limit=10&role=admin
      ```
      
      **Response Example**:
      ```json
      {
        "data": [

    --language "{{detected_language}}"
```

2. **Examples**: Luôn include ít nhất 1 example
3. **Output format**: Chỉ rõ format mong muốn
4. **Edge cases**: Handle edge cases trong template
5. **Post-processing**: Validate output
